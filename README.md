AndroidLibSpotifyWrapper
========================

A libSpotify wrapper for Android

Feel free to contribute to the project!

Based on https://github.com/spotify/psyonspotify libSpotify wrapper. The aim of this project is to implement as many calls to the libspotify library as possible.

FLOW

*Login->ShowPlaylists->SelectPlaylist->ViewSongDetails->PlaySong

The app isnt aimed at providing a particularly good user experience but rather a type of Spotify HelloWorld to showcase the integration with libSpotify, and make it easy for others to copy,  as I don't believe there is a fully fledged libSpotify wrapper available for Android yet.
														
DONE SO FAR:

*Track Playback (psyonspotify)
*Track Starring (psyonspotify)
*Login (psyonspotify)
*Basic playlist population

DOING NOW:

*Tracklist population

TO BE DONE:

*everything else! searching, browsing, etc.
